# This is example rules file defining behavior of cleaner.
# You can modify it to suit your needs.

# Basic concepts are:
#   - When repository does not match any rule, it is left untouched
#   - When tag does not match any rule, it is left untouched
#   - Rules are evaluated from top to bottom, first match is applied.
#   - Tag rules are evaluated from top to bottom, first match is applied.
#   - Only one action can be specified per tag (last, maxAge, keep). Not combination.

# The rules are processed from first to last. First matched rule wins.
rules:
  # Matches all repositories by default
  - repoRegExp: "."
    # Tags are processed from first to last. First matched rule wins.
    tags:
      # Last 5 version-like tags are kept
      - name: versions
        tagRegExp: '^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+'
        last: 5
      # GIT commit tags are kept from last 14 days
      - name: commits
        tagRegExp: '^[0-9a-fA-F]{40}$'
        maxAge: 14d
        last: 1
      # Other tags are kept as is.
      - name: others
        tagRegExp: '.'
        keep: true
